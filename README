NAME
    Bash::Completion::Plugins::VimTag - Bash completion plugin for tags
    generated by Vim::Tag

VERSION
    version 1.110690

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Bash::Completion plugin that can complete on tags generated by
    the "ptags" program that is included in the Vim-Tag distribution. It
    completes on the "vit" command, which you can use as a bash alias for
    "vi -t".

METHODS
  should_activate
    Says that this plugin should activate if "ptags" is in the path.

  generate_bash_setup
    Defines that this plugin should be used for the "vit" command or bash
    alias.

    Why does "should_activate()" use a different command? "ptags" is the
    program that generates the tags, but "vit" (alias for "vi -t") is the
    command for which we want to complete.

  complete
    Takes a request and returns possible candidates from the file specified
    by $ENV{PTAGSFILE}.

PLANS
    *   Completing only on "vit" and expecting it to be a bash alias for "vi
        -t" is too restrictive.

INSTALLATION
    See perlmodinstall for information and options on installing Perl
    modules.
